# Classification-for-Data-Analysis

This project analyzes diabetic retinopathy data from the Debrecen dataset, utilizing machine learning algorithms like SGD, Neural Network,
and CART. Tools such as RapidMiner Studio, Weka, and VSCode were employed to explore 19 attributes across 1151 samples for accurate
classification. A Python program was developed to implement and evaluate these models, showcasing expertise in machine learning and
programming
